SensoryFlow Logo generated and integrated.
Prompt: 'A modern, high-tech logo for a Chrome extension called SensoryFlow. The center features a sophisticated 3D glassmorphism orb (The Core) that seems to glow from within. Around the orb, there are fluid, translucent ribbons of light in emerald green, warm amber, and vibrant violet, weaving together to represent Sensory Flow.'
